Semantic knowledge representations have not evolved since the Semantic
Web was proposed during the 1990s. Modern graph databases offer new
possibilities for knowledge representation, but the methods are poorly
developed and require the use of specialized query languages and
clumsy outdated formats. This project aims to make semantic maps easy
for general use, using standard SQL databases and modern lightweight
data formats. A user workflow starts from a simple note-taking
language, then ingesting into a database using a graph model based on
the causal semantic spacetime model, to the use of a simple web
application for supporting graph searches and data presentation. The
aim is to make a generally useful library for incorporating into other
applications, or running as a standalone notebook service.
