# SSTorytime

* This is a work in progress for 2025, as part of an [NLnet project](https://nlnet.nl/project/SmartSemanticDataLookup/) *

This project aims to make knowledge capture, querying, and dissemination easy for humans
for general use. AI can only capture knowledge from humans, so even if we
want to use AI, we'd better get the knowledge representations right.

Knowledge capture requires tools for collecting notes, and structures
for representing and organizing them, so that they can be found
easily. Many mistakes have been made around this in the past, trying
to force discipline onto people at the wrong moment and neglecting to
do so when it matters. As a lifelong teacher of ideas, I've studied
this problem and think we can do better than what we have today.

* [N4L - Notes For Learning/Loading](docs/N4L.md)


## The tools

The toolset consistent of several components.

* [N4L](docs/N4L.md) - a unicode text based note taking language for jotting down notes in a way
        that can be parsed and loaded into a semantic database. 
        N = note, 4 = 4 semantic type, L = language
        N4L = notes for loading
