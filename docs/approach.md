### An approach to knowledge

*If you want to know the deep thought behind an apparently ad hoc bit of
software, please take a look at [the project's own research website](http://markburgess.org/spacetime.html).*

We tend to confuse knowledge with our *desire* for knowledge. In fact,
you might say we covet other people's knowledge, but we don't always
understand what that means. If somebody else knows the answer, that's
`world knowledge', but it's not ours.

Do we need to know so much? There's, of course, an argument about not
having to know everything ourselves. Then we need knowledge about how
to make use of other people's knowledge.  In the past, we've taken
this for granted because it all sort of worked out when things were
slower and there were fewer people and pressures on us all.  What's
new in the modern world is the *pace* of change, and the rate at which
our old world knowledge expires. We need to update ourselves by
deepening our relationships to what we want to know as the world
accelerates. It's becoming stressful, and this places a focus on tools like
databases and Artificial Intelligence to relieve that stress---but they
are a devil's bargain, because they require us to trust *unknowingly*.

Knowledge management is not really about writing stuff down, filing
it, or putting is in a database. Knowledge existed before writing was
invented; animals know things without using the World Wide
Web. Knowledge management is more like tending a garden. You discover,
you plant, you have to tend to growth, you organize, and you have to
pull weeds and fix damage *yourself*. Eventually, you learn your way
around the garden, where to pick flowers and vegetables. The bigger
the garden, the more effort it takes to reach this level of
familiarity.  So where are the knowledge tractors and harvesters?

The key thing is that---to acquire knowledge---you have to have the
intent to do it all yourself, otherwise it's merely someone else's
knowledge. It requires our attention! We can't pass that on to someone else.

## Delegating and working together

So why not trust others? Why not just trust Artificial Intelligence and databases?
The simple answer is that we need to know enough to judge whether what others
tell us is reliable.

Because we can't know and do everything ourselves, we've learned to
work together. Trusting others' knowledge and skill allows us to make
use of it, without understanding all the details. But we do need to
check their homework for errors and for negligence. As soon as we
delegate, we become managers and inspectors if we want to know
anything at all---otherwise, we've simply accepted ignorance.

When we delegate, we exchange our knowledge for trust in someone or
something else; but trust is also about knowing! We exchange our
knowing of facts or skills with the knowing about the accuracy of the
person, book, or assistant (human or otherwise) that we're relying on.

## Stories

When we're familar with `knowledge' (which is the actual definition of
it), we communicate by telling stories about it.  A story is much more
than idle gossip about unfamiliar hearsay: it has to make sense, it
has to be grounded in intimate detail. Condensing knowledge into
*intentional* stories (at different levels of detail for different
purposes) helps us to pass on knowledge.  Some stories are about
solving problems, others are merely descriptive lessons learned.

Gardens aside, one could say that generating familiarity and
maintaining knowledge is like scaling the activity in a city. Time is
driven by parallel events arriving. The more people, the faster the
pace or pulse. We have to let this evolve, like the weather. You can't
easy capture the weather, but with a little ingenuity you can put up a
sail to ride the wind, and learn yourself to know its currents.

## Remembering and forgetting

Memory has a horizon.  Things we learn, thoughts that we have, are
easily lost and forgotten.  Writing stuff down (intructions,
experiences, etc) seems like a good idea, but it's useless if no one
reads what is written regularly. It doesn't matter how you try to
remember something. If you don't use the memory, revisit it
frequently, it will decay to nothing.  This is why most Wikis and
documentation efforts fail. Writing notes for occasional use once a
year, or only in case of emergency is pointless unless it's used and
rehearsed often.  Wikipedia succeeds on average for a population
because it's many to many interaction, which keeps the pulse of
interaction alive: someone is always looking at the information. But
that doen't mean that you, an individual, will learn from what is
written there. Even Wikipedia information is not knowledge unless it's
in someone's head. To the causal browser, it is merely information,
even hearsay. Knowledge for the population is different from knowledge
for a single person. A library doesn't make you smart if you don't read
the books. So engineering knowledge involves engineering habits and behaviour.

## Tools make work easier?

We're talking about knowing how to acquire and retain knowledge.
Technology can help, but it can also get us stuck doing the wrong
thing. If we take away too much of the work from people, people will forget
how to do the work. That's how knowledge works. 

Semantic knowledge representations have not evolved since the
Semantic Web was proposed during the 1990s, at a time when the
technology was primitive and the technologists weren't themselves
experienced in how to use it.

Recently, graph databases have seemed to offer new possibilities for
knowledge representation, but the methods for using them have been
poorly developed and require the use of specialized query languages
and clumsy outdated formats.  In this project, I'm shifting the focus
away from technology to to content. We can use standard SQL databases
and modern lightweight data formats so embrace familiarity. The aim is
not to pickle a a static knowledge graph like an RDF structure, but
rather to establish a context dependent switching network of thoughts
that form stories. There's some overlap with what Large Language Models
do, but they take away control from the user. Here we give it back.

A user workflow starts from a simple note-taking language, then by
ingesting it into a database using a graph model based on the causal
semantic spacetime model, to the use of a simple web application for
supporting graph searches and data presentation. The aim is to make a
generally useful library for incorporating into other applications, or
running as a standalone notebook service.

To devise a knowledge management system, our aims are:

* To assist in overcoming human limitations, while respecting the reason for them.
* To devise a way of getting experiences and thoughts into a computer representation
that will be used actively and immediately. For this, we shall devise a language N4L
or Notes For Learning.

The structure of cognition lies in decoding input into a lasting invariant
representation, which is linked to a rich set of very familiar contexts,
 with reactive output and post-associative feedback that expands the integration of what you've
memorized.

The distinction between an **input representation**, **recall**, and **``information
usability''** (the process of distilling something useful) is the
basic problem to be tackled. It's the same process we face when attempting to learn
a foreign language: out mental model is spontaneous, but forcing it
through the bottleneck of language is hard, because we don't know all
the words and we may never have tried to say what we want to say
before.  We would like to ensure that there is a sufficient reservoir
of examples to draw on and use as templates.

We may try to `cram' words into memory by repetition, but in the heat of the moment
we're unable to recall any of it. That's because memory lookup is contextual,
and the context in which we experience it and the context in which we try to learn it
are totally different---and we don't know how to connect the two.

Part of our difficulty in making notes and organizing is also our lack
of an overview. It doesn't take very much information to fill a page
and exceed our visual resolution. Even if we could organize everything
on a single sheet, our ability to resolve and comprehend it is
limited. So what we need is a way of integrating disjointed fragments
of note-taking to create that integrated model.

## Tidying up is a learning strategy

If you do it once, it just hides information. If you keep doing to improve and fiddle with the
organization of things, you become intimately and cognitively familiar with the placement and
usefulness of things. This is what our brains do. There has to be re-use activity, involving motor
functions to extract things from their tidy places.

## Memory strategy and organization

When we tidy, often we create subject boxes first. It's by putting
something in the right box that we believe we understand it.  For
example, when writing this, I write a number of section titles and try
to collect everything related to it under each heading..

Reorganizing notes post-hoc is very time consuming, because it
requires multiple passes and many decisions.  Unless we intentionally
place fragments of experience into boxes initially and intentionally,
we lose the economic benefits of experience. Intent thus serves an
economic function for a cognitive agent.

But there is a problem with this. When we group things together, we
made trade-offs and approximations that we might not agree with
later. For instance, is a a duckbilled platypus a mammal or a bird.
It's a warm blooded species that lays eggs. It flouts the boundaries
of the largest boxes in biology by belonging to two boxes or a box all
by itself. When we rely on box logic, things always go wrong in the
end.  This is the trouble with ontologies as we use them in technology
today. The main benefit of doing this is that it forces us to revisit
the model over and over again and make connections. We then identify
knowledge with those "aha!" moments at which we independently had
insights. Those are the moments we remember and can recall what we
learned.

Our philosophical affectations have led us to go too far, however,
when we form entire world *ontologies* and try to fit everything into
a single common spanning tree of knowledge. This is an abuse of
process, because ontologies are only outgrowths of coordinate systems
for indexing {\em contexts}. They belong to a separate sensory
language that represents experience, not the concepts derived from
cumulative processing and metaphoric expansion.

The temptation to continue classifying and sub-classifying by
inventing ad hoc discriminators is a powerful tendency that
occasionally runs riot and appeals to the bureaucratic mind. Even
though applying discriminators from general experience ad hoc seems
like a smart approach, it easily
 leads to tunnel vision.
