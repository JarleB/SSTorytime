We pass on knowledge by telling stories or building narratives. Some of these

## N4L, a note taking language

### Minimal syntax

We would like a simple free text format for entering data, without
specialized encodings, for the first phase of jotting down items of
information that we want to learn and know.  This language must support Unicode for multi-language
support.  Memory data may come in a variety of media formats: text,
images, audio etc. When we are searching, however, symbolic language
is a convenient interaction format. So, in a first instance, we can
use pattern matching transducers to convert multimedia formats into
``alt texts'' and categorize those in a knowledge reasoning structure.
This may not strictly be necessary in the long run, but it's a useful
place to begin: in particular we need the ability to identify
sub-parts of an image of audio segment in order to cross-reference it.

The basic syntactic format of the contextual note taking language takes the following form:
