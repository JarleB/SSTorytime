human brain (consists of) forebrain, midbrain, hindbrain

neocortex (structure) modular repeating columns in 6 layers
     "    (function)  accumulating knowledge 
     "    (history)   outgrowth of hypothalamus

hypothalamus (role) key nexus between body and brain , vital decision making circuits
     "     (located) forebrain
     "     (function) monitoring signals in the bloodstream and neural signals
     "     (controls) hormones
     "     (function) regulate bodily functionsâ€”blood pressure, heart rate, enzyme levels, digestion, gut peristalsis, sweating, shivering, sleep, arousal
     "     (comment) hypothalamus is extensively interconnected with other brain regions that collectively provide signals that motivate different types of behaviors, with varying levels of urgency. The resultant signals of need may be experienced as hunger, thirst, tiredness, cold, pain, fear, and so on; that is, basic emotions. These naturally 

 "     (controls) urges to eat, drink, sleep, find shelter, avoid whatever is causing pain or fear, or respond with defensive or aggressive behaviours.

 " (history) early telencephalon meaning the end of the brain
 " (evolved to) ultimately expand in mammals to become the neocortex

hormones (controls) autonomic nervous system 

thalamus (located) forebrain

retinal ganglia (located) optic nerve
     "         (send to) tectum, thalamus

columnar organization hypothesis

column (part of) neocortex 
column (depends on) tectum, thalamus

// Each column is thus a functional unit designed to take in a variety of inputs, operate on them in some way, communicate with neighbouring column 


basal ganglia (located) below cortex, forebrain
     "         (structure) nested circuit loops
     "         (function) mediates evaluatuon and selection of actions 
     "         (depends on) signal from midbrain about reward/punishment/surprise 
inner chamber

hippocampus  (function) learning and memory
     "      (function) creates temporary structured episodic record 
     "      (function) structured for causal relationships A causes B

tectum (function) maps incoming sensory stimulus to a menu of actions (instinct)
   "   (function) performs various kinds of neural operations, using these integrated maps of different kinds of stimuli to derive an optimal action
   "   (method) attractive signals engage a winner-takes-all competition
   "   (promise type) conditional promises
 
       (located) top of midbrain

layer 1 (function) top down modulation
        (speculate) intentions?

layer 2, layer 3 (function) collect sensory information and integrate with neighbouring columns

layer 4 (function) receive inputs from other brain areas

layer 5 (function) take signals from 2,3 and context and redistribute
   "    (send to) tectum, cortex, spine, other hemisphere 

layer 6 (function) feedback mainly to thalamus
   "    (send to) back to thalamus

thalamus (function) conduit/relay station for sensory information
   "     (function) performs significant processing/compression on input

affordances (function) what we can do with a object or service
   "   (promise type) conditional promises

neurons that fire together wire together

hippocampus (contains) physical structures/neural circuits (represents) cortex embody knowledge


encoding meaning as "things" is efficient conceptualisation, which is a coarse graining of spacetime pattern persistence and recurrence.
