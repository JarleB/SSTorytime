The files in this directory serve as examples of the N4L note-taking language in various stages of completion.
The important thing about making notes is not to make them a perfect reference, but to serve as a work in progress.

It's by continuously revisiting and improving, tidying, and extending notes that you learn the most. Then
being able to query your notes meaningfully helps to bolster the memory you already have.
