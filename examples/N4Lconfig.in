 	# Define arrow causal directions ... left to right
 	# what does A -----> B mean, and what is its opposite?

 	# causal order, preconditions, succession

 	+ forwards (fwd) - backwards (bwd)      # A (forwards)	B,  B (backwards) A
 	+ affects  (af)  - affected by (baf)  	# A (affects) 	B,  B (affected by) A
 	+ causes   (cf)  - is caused by (cb)
 	+ leads to (to)  - comes from (fr)
        + is followed by (next) - is preceded by (prev)    
        + then the next is (then) - previous (prior)

 	# these next two are mutually complementary interpretations

 	+ succeeded by (succ) - preceded by (pre)
 	+ comes before (bfr)  - comes after (aft)

 	# these translations are causal transformations, not just properties.
 	# they have transitive meaning

 	# if we insist on using + or - in the name, then quote it

 	+ "positive (+)" (+) - "negative (-)" (-)


        # More examples to play with, semantics are always reversible

 	+ results in (res) - comes from (comfr)
 	+ depends on (dep) - drives (drv)
 	+ influences (infl) - is influenced by (isinfl)

        # Numbers can be interpreted either as set order (value) 
        # or by set containment (count), so be careful with semantics!

        # succeeds is more accurate in terms of order
        #
	# + is less than (lt) - is greater than (gt)
